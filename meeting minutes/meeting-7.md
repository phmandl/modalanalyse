#### Team: The Coupled Oscillators

#### Roles
Maximilian Hoffmann (chairman)
Philip Mandl (secretary)
Richard Schreiner
Tae-Hyong Kim

#### Main Discussion
We disscused our code parts. Starting first with the modal mass participation factor: Here we saw that the solution can be easily
interpreted with the solution from HW2. Next the static pressure displacment part depicted problems with applying the pressure
correctly. However, all problems were solved with pain and sweat.

#### Main Difficulty
Application of pressure distribution on the surfaces. Furthermore, building the rotation matrix is a pain in the ass.

#### Main Insight
When extracting notes one needs to be really careful when replacing them again.
