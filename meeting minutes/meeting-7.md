## Main Discussion
We disscused our code parts. Starting first with the modal mass participation factor: Here we saw that the solution can be easily
interpreted with the figures plotted in HW2. Next the static pressure displacment part depicted problems with applying the pressure
correctly. However, all problems were solved with pain and sweat.

## Main Difficulty
Application of pressure distribution on the surfaces. Furthermore, plotting the results in a usefull manner is challenging.

## Main Insight
When extracting nodes one needs to be really careful when replacing them again.
Plotting the time depending displacments via different modal reduced systems yield two different solutions. This needs further investigation from our side.
