## Main Discussion
1. The Coupeld Oscillators met online using a Discord server.
2. We  observed the lecture about Model Reduction via a Modal Subspace.
3. After that we changed a few things on our internal organization, since merging iPython-files is not as easy as expected.
4. Then, went through the iPython-Tamplate of excercise 3.
5. We distributed the tasks:
      #) Philipp: Constraint Enforcement, Mode Shapes
      #) Richi: Modal mass participation factor, Static Deformation
      #) Taeyong: Transient Solution, Task 1
      #) Max: Steady State Oscillation | Frequency Domain, Task 2
6. Last but not least we made up the date for the next meeting: 27.04.2020; 09:00


## Main Difficulty

## Main Insight
We are able to apply a lot from previous excercises.
