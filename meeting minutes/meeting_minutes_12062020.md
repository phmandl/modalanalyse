### Meeting minutes of 2020/06/12 (09:00-10:00)

#### Present:

Schreiner Richard 

Kim Tae-Hyong 

Hoffmann Maximilian (Chairman)

Mandl Philipp (Secretary)

#### Main discussion:

The coupled oscillators met online using a discord server. Discussed our solutions to Task 1 und Task 2: We faced some problems with the definition of accelerance, receptance and came to the conclusion that our peak finding method is right, but requires some small changes. Another point was the receptance matrix for the mode shapes.

#### Main difficulty

Finding the half power points. We used linear interpolation to find them. Problems with Point 5 of our peaks which have a valley between two peaks and one half power points is on the wrong location. Circle Fitting problems with the gradients of d_gamma/d_omega were discussed. For Kim the main difficulity was to calculate the receptance matrix for the mode shapes.

#### Main insight

We obtained the knowledge that the window reduces the noise. Difficult problems circle fitted transfer functions and receptance functions for mode shapes, however, problems which should be easy to fix. ITD methdod is coming togehter really well, should be finished quite soon.
