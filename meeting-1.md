## Main discussion:

At this first meeting we first introduced ourselves to one another, and
briefly shared our experiences of group work. Afterwards, there was a
heated argument about the team name until we could all agree on
’The modal hammers’. We discussed the content of the overview lecture and
could resolve some points not everyone had understood. We then discussed
the distribution of work for the homework exercises and the theory paper.
Main Difficulty:
Where does the discretised system of equations come from?
Main Insight:
There are may ways to arrive at a system of coupled ODEs.
Next meeting:
We decided to have a follow-up meeting before the workshop
where we will:
4

Arthur
- review the layout of the paper prepared by Edith
