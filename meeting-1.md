# Meeting minutes of 2020/03/11

## Team:
Coupled Oscillators

Present:
Schreiner Richard (Chairman)
Kim Tae-Hyong (Scretary)
Hoffmann Maximilian
Mandl Philipp

## Main discussion:

After closing the technical university due to the Covid-2019, we held our first meeting online on discord. First of all we appointed chairman and secretary for this meeting and started to introduce ourselves to our team. Our first team tasks was to agree on a team name. After a heated discussion we came up with our new team name: "The Coupled Oscillators." We started to get a brief overview on the first submission tasks and repeated the notes from the first lecture. Then we launched a github repository to optimzie our workflow and started with the work distribution. 

## Main difficulty

Getting organized and connected with each other.

## Main insight

There are many ways to arrive a system of ODE's

## To do untill next meeting

Next meeting will be on 18th of March at 9am:

  - Briefing on current workflow
  
  - Merging all results

## Distribution of work for Exercise 1

Maximilian & Philipp programmed the functions for eigeenvalue solvers.
Richard programmed the function on QR-algorithm and computed a different static problem for the mode shapes.
Tae-Hyong visualizd the structure of the system matrices, the geometry and natural frequencies and computed oscillation modes for different boundary conditions.
All team members participated equally in the discussion of the results
finished the submission tasks together.
